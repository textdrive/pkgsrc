# Maintainer notes:
#
# This package is similar to wip/trac, which in turn structurally
# matches www/ja-trac.  Ideally, www/trac and ja-trac would converge.
# This note outlines the known differences and proposed resolution.
# Besides bringing the packages closer, a goal is to avoid breaking
# existing trac installations that blindly upgrade, to the extent that
# this is reasonable.
#
# subversion dependency: ja-trac does not depend on subversion,
# because 1) trac is useful without a repo, and because one can use
# other than svn.  Perhaps options to specify repo support (not a
# group, because trac can support multiple), defaulting to subversion
# is a good strategy for now.
#
# www/trac options are not in options.mk (to be fixed).
#
# sqlite2 vs sqlite3: This package has logic to choose sqlite2 vs
# sqlite3, and ja-trac uses only sqlite2.  This is hard, because
# database format changes are disruptive, and gdt should consult
# upstream's idea of best practice.
