.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sysupgrade.conf
.Nd configuration file to control NetBSD system upgrades
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Configuration files for
.Xr sysupgrade 8
are simple shell scripts that set, or explicitly clear, a collection of known
configuration variables.
.Pp
The following configuration variables are recognized:
.Bl -tag
.It Va AUTOCLEAN
Whether to automatically delete the downloaded files or not as part of the
.Sq auto
command.
.Pp
If you set
.Va ETCUPDATE
to false, you will probably want to disable autocleaning.
This will let you run the
.Sq etcupdate
command on your own at a later stage reusing the same distribution sets used to
upgrade the system.
.Pp
Default: yes.
.It Va CACHEDIR
Path to the local directory into which distribution sets are temporarily fetched
while applying a system upgrade.
Note that all
.Nm
commands that need access to the distribution sets (pretty much all of them)
will read from this directory.
If you plan on issuing different upgrade steps at different times, this
directory should persist across the different executions.
.Pp
Default:
.Pa @SYSUPGRADE_CACHEDIR@
.It Va DESTDIR
Path to the root of the system to be upgraded.
This is prepended to all other paths affected by
.Xr sysupgrade 8
and can be used to perform upgrades of non-live systems or for testing
purposes.
.Pp
Default: not set (which means
.Pa /
is affected).
.It Va ETCUPDATE
Whether to run
.Xr etcupdate 8
as part of an automated upgrade.
You may want to disable this because this is the only interactive step in the
upgrade process.
.Pp
If set to false, the
.Sq auto
subcommand will skip this step.
In this case, you are also recommended to set
.Va AUTOCLEAN
to
.Sq no
so that you are not required to redownload the distribution files just to run
.Xr etcupdate 8
later.
.Pp
Default: yes.
.It Va KERNEL
Name of the kernel to install.
There must be a
.Sq netbsd-<KERNEL>.gz
file in the release directory matching this name.
.Pp
If this is set to the magic value
.Sq AUTO ,
.Xr sysupgrade 8
will attempt to automatically determine the name of the current kernel by using
.Xr config 1
on
.Pa <DESTDIR>/netbsd .
If the guessing fails, an error is raised to prevent installing a mismatching
kernel.
.Pp
Default: AUTO.
.It Va POSTINSTALL_AUTOFIX
Whitespace-separated list of
.Xr postinstall 8
checks that will be unconditionally fixed as part of an upgrade.
.Pp
It is recommended that you include
.Sq obsolete
in this list at the very least: this check often fails because it is common for
newer releases to drop existing files, and fixing it should be harmless.
Note that old shared libraries are never cleaned by this check, so existing
third-party binaries should not stop working even after auto-fixing this check.
.Pp
Default: empty.
.It Va RELEASEDIR
Location of the release directory (which must hold a
.Pa binary/sets/
subdirectory).
This can be either a local path or a URL.
.Pp
If the location is a URL, any of the HTTP, FTP or SSH protocols are supported.
In the case of SSH, the URL takes the form:
.Sq ssh://[user[:password]@]<host>/<absolute_path> ,
which is different to the syntax accepted by
.Xr scp 1 .
.Pp
Default: not set.
.It Va SETS
Whitespace-separated list of distribution sets to install.
If this is set to the magic value
.Sq AUTO ,
the list of sets is determined from the files in
.Pa <DESTDIR>/etc/mtree .
.Pp
This list cannot include any
.Sq kern-*
sets; the kernel to be installed is determined by the
.Va KERNEL
variable.
.Pp
The presence of any configuration sets (such as
.Sq etc
or
.Sq xetc )
in this list enables the etcupdate and postinstall steps in the automated
upgrade procedure.
.Pp
The presence of a modules set enables the modules step in the automated upgrade
procedure.
.Pp
Default: AUTO.
