.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sysbuild.conf
.Nd configuration file format for the sysbuild tool
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Configuration files for
.Xr sysbuild 1
are plain shell scripts that define a set of recognized variables.
.Pp
As scripts, they can perform any magic they desire to deduce the value of
the configuration variables.
For example, the default configuration file shipped with
.Xr sysbuild 1
automatically deduces the value of the
.Va NJOBS
variable by looking at how many CPUs are available in the system.
.Pp
The following variables configure the source trees:
.Bl -tag -width INCREMENTAL_BUILD
.It Va CVSROOT
Location of the CVS root from which to check out or update the src and xsrc
modules.
.Pp
Default:
.Sq :ext:anoncvs@anoncvs.NetBSD.org:/cvsroot
.It Va CVSTAG
CVS tag to use during checkouts or updates of the src and xsrc modules.
.Pp
Default: not defined.
.It Va SRCDIR
Path to the src module.
If you want
.Xr sysbuild 1
to perform an update of this directory before every build, you will need
write access to it.
Otherwise, you can use a read-only directory.
.Pp
Default:
.Pa /usr/src .
.It Va UPDATE_SOURCES
Whether to perform an update of the source tree before every build or not.
.Pp
Default:
.Sq true .
.It Va XSRCDIR
Path to the xsrc module.
If you want
.Xr sysbuild 1
to perform an update of this directory before every build, you will need
write access to it.
Otherwise, you can use a read-only directory.
.Pp
Defining this variable causes
.Xr sysbuild 1
to build the X Window System as part of the build of
.Nx .
.Pp
Default: not defined.
.El
.Pp
The following variables configure the location of the build files:
.Bl -tag -width INCREMENTAL_BUILD
.It Va BUILD_ROOT
Path to the directory in which to place build files.
These include the obj tree, the destdir and the cross-build tools generated
by the
.Nm build.sh
script.
The contents of this directory are sorted by machine type so that it can be
shared across builds for different machines.
.Pp
Default:
.Pa ~/sysbuild/ .
.It Va RELEASEDIR
Path to the directory that will contain the build products (aka the release
files).
The contents of this directory are sorted by machine type so that it can be
shared across builds for different machines.
.Pp
Default:
.Pa ~/sysbuild/release .
.El
.Pp
The following variables configure the build process:
.Bl -tag -width INCREMENTAL_BUILD
.It Va BUILD_TARGETS
Whitespace-separated list of targets to pass to
.Nm build.sh
during builds.
Targets can be prefixed by a machine name and a colon, in which case they only
apply to that machine; for example,
.Sq macppc:kernel=${HOME}/CUSTOM macppc:releasekernel=${HOME}/CUSTOM .
.Pp
Default:
.Sq release .
.It Va INCREMENTAL_BUILD
Whether to perform update builds or not.
An update build reuses existing obj, destdir and tools trees.
.Pp
Of special note is that
.Xr sysbuild 1
will take care of pruning files likely to cause breakage during update
builds before performing the build itself.
As an example, this includes deleting all the modules from
.Pa destdir/stand/<platform>/ .
.Pp
Default:
.Sq false .
.It Va MACHINES
Whitespace-separated list of machine types to build for.
.Pp
Default: the name of the host machine type.
.It Va MKVARS
Whitespace-separated list of
.Sq VARIABLE=value
.Xr make 1
variable definitions to be set during the build.
A useful example would be:
.Sq MKVARS="MKDEBUG=yes" .
.Pp
Default: not defined.
.It Va NJOBS
Number of parallel jobs to use during the build.
If not set, disables parallel builds (which, due to
.Nm make 1
semantics, is not the same as setting this to 1).
.Pp
Default: not defined.
